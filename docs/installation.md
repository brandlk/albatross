# Installation

Prerequisites:

You need to have the Ocaml compile and the Ocaml package manager `opam`
installed.

- `opam install alba`

In order to work with the Albatross compiler you have to install and compile
the basic library.

- `mkdir <alba-libs>`         # directory where you want to store libraries><
- `cd <alba-libs>`
- `wget https://github.com/hbr/alba.base/archive/x.y.z.tar.gz` where `x.y.z`
  is the version of the library you want to install.
- `tar xzf x.y.z.tar.gz`
- `mv alba.base-x.y.z alba.base`
- `alba init -work-dir alba.base`
- `alba compile -work-dir alba.base`


After the installation you can go the source directory of your Albatross
sources and issue

    alba init                    -- to initialize the directory
    alba compile -I <alba-libs>  -- to compile your sources


Instead of using the `-I` option explicitly to indicate the location of the
libraries you can also set the environment variable `ALBA_LIBRARY_PATH`
to <alba-libs> and then ommit the `-I <alba-libs>`.
