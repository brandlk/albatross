Results for Computability Theory
================================


Language Definition
-------------------


Definition:

>   A language `L = (P, eval)` consists of a set `P` of programs where `P` is a
>   subset of the natural numbers and an evaluation function

>       eval: P x N -> N

>   which is a partial function. It is decidable, if a natural number is a
    program, i.e. there is a total computable function `valid: N -> {0,1}` where `valid
    (n) = 1` means that `n` is a valid program.

We define programs in the domain of natural numbers. This is not a restriction,
because every file or collection of files can be interpreted as a natural
number, because they are sequence of bytes and every sequence of bytes can be
mapped one-to-one to a natural number.

Furthermore we consider only functions from natural numbers to natural numbers.
This is not a restriction either for the same argument.

Note that partial functions are functional relations, i.e. `r n m1` and
`r n m2` imply `m1 = m2` when `r` is a functional relation. A relation is left
total, if for all `x` in its domain there is a `y` such that `r x y`. Therefore
a functional, left-total relation represents a total function.

Definition:

>   A language is total, if its evaluation function is total.




Implementation of Functions
---------------------------

Definition:

>   Assume a language `L = (P,eval)`. We say that an `F in P` implements a
>   function `f: N -> N`, if

>       eval(F, m) = f(m)

>   for all `m in N`.


Definition:

> A language `L = (P, eval)` is closed under composition if for all functions
> `f` and `g` which it implements, it implements the composition of the
> functions `f` and `g` as well.





Interpretation of a Language
----------------------------

Definition:

>   Assume two languages `L1 = (P1, eval1)` and `L2 = (P2, eval2)`. We say that
>   `L1` *interprets* `L2` if there is an interpreter program `u` in `P1` such
>   that

>       eval1(u, <n,m>) ~ eval2(n, m)

>   for all valid programs `n` in `P2` and `m` in `N`.


In this definition we use a pairing function `<n,m>` which maps each pair of
natural numbers one-to-one to a natural number.

Furthermore we don't use equality in this definition. We use equivalence. I.e.
if `eval1(u, <n,m>)` is undefined, then `eval2(n, m)` is undefined as well and
vice versa. If both functions are defined for the arguments, then they
return the same value.


A language `L = (P, eval)` interprets itself, if it has an interpreter program
`u` such that

    eval(u, <n,m>) ~ eval(n, m)

for all valid programs `n`.





Total Languages cannot interpret themselves
-------------------------------------------


In the following we prove the fact that a total language cannot interpret
itself as long as it implements at least the successor function and the diagonal
function and is closed under composition.

Assume that `L = (P, eval)` is a total language which has an interpreter program
`u` which implements self interpretation.

Therefore we get for all valid programs `n` and all natural numbers `m`

    eval(u, <n,m>) = eval(n,m)

Here we have equality, because being a total language the evaluation function is
total.

According to our definitions, the program `u` implements the function

    x |-> eval(u, x)

because of the triviality

    eval (u, x) = eval(u, x)

Furthermore we have the programs `succ` and `diag` such that

    eval(succ, m) = m + 1

    eval(diag, m) = <m,m>

Now we define a function `f: N -> N` as

    f(k) := 1 + eval(u, <k,k>)

In that definition it is crucial, that the language is total. Therefore `eval`
is total and the above definition is a valid function definition. If the
language were not total, the above definition of `f` would be illegal.

Because the language is closed under composition, there is a program `F` such
that

    eval(F, k) = f(k)

for all natural numbers `k`.

Now we form `eval(u, <F,F>)` and get

    eval(u, <F,F>)

    = eval(F, F)            -- `u` is interpreter program

    = f(F)                  -- `F` implements `f`

    = 1 + eval(u, <F,F>)    -- definition of `f`

This is a contradiction because a number and its successor cannot be equal.
Therefore our assumptions are wrong and either the language `L` is not total or
the language does not interpret itself.







Compiling
=========

Machine Language
----------------

We assume that we have a machine language
```
    LM = (PM, evalM)
```

whose programs are numbers representing a programs in machine language which can
implement one argument functions on natural numbers.

Cleary the machine language is not total. I.e. there are machine programs `n`
such that `evalM(n, m)` is not defined for all `m`.

The machine is basically a computer which executes a machine program given as a
file which we represent here by a natural numbers on a certain input file, which
we represent by an natural number as well, and outputs another file which we
represent by a natural number as well.




Language Definition with a Compiler
-----------------------------------

Definition:

>   A compiler from language `A = (PA, evalA)` to language `B = (PB, evalB)`
>   written in language `C = (PC, evalC)` is a program `C_ABC` from `PC` which
>   takes as input a program `S_A` from `PA` and produces a program `T_A` from
>   `PB` as output.

>   If `A`, `B` and `C` are given, the following should hold for all natural
>   numbers `m` and all valid programs `S_A`:

>       evalA(S_A, m) ~ evalB(evalC(C_ABC, S_A), m)

If we want the compiler `C_ABC` to implement a total function, we can slightly
modify the previous definition and require that `C_ABC` implements the function
`f_ABC` with

```
                   /  <1, T_A>,   if S_A in PA
    f_ABC := p -> |
                   \  <0,0>,      otherwise
```

Since `PA` is decidable, `f_ABC` is total and hence `evalC(C_ABC, p)` is defined
for all natural numbers `p` and we require

```
    evalA(S_A, m) ~ evalB(second(evalC(C_ABC, S_A)), m)
```
to hold for all natural numbers `m` and all valid programs `S_A`.

We can also **define** a language `A = (PA, evalA)` by a compiler `C_ABC`. The
compiler takes as input a natural number `p` and produces a program `T_A` in
target language `B` (e.i. an element of `PB`) or outputs an error.

The compiler `C_ABC` distinguishes success and error by implementing a total function

```
    f_ABC: N -> <1,PB> V <0,0>
```

We can now define the language `A=(PA, evalA)` as follows:

```
    PA := { n in N | first(evalC(C_ABC, n)) = 1 }
```
Since `f_ABC` is total, `PA` is decidable.

```
    evalA(S_A, m) :=
        evalB(
            second(evalC(C_ABC, S_A)),
            m
        )
```

This completes the definition of the language `A = (PA, evalA)`.

Language `A` is total if its evaluation function `evalA` is total. Since we did
not require `B` to be a total language, `evalA` is total iff `evalC(C_ABC, S_A)`
does only produce target code `T_A` in `PB` which implements a total function.




Implement a Compiler in its own Language
----------------------------------------

What does it mean to implement a compiler of a high level language in its own
language?

In this case the source language and the implementing language are the same, so
we call such a compiler `C_ABA`. `C_ABA` is a compiler from source language `A`
to target language `B` written in the source language `A`, i.e. `C_ABA` is an
element of `PA`.

Let language `A = (PA, evalA)` be defined by the compiler `C_ABC`.
If `C_ABA` really implements a compiler of `A`, then the following equivalence
must be valid

```
    evalA(C_ABA, S_A) ~  evalB(C_ABC, S_A)
```

I.e. both `C_ABA` and `C_ABC` must compile the same source code `S_A` into the
same target code `T_A` if `S_A` is a valid `A` program or both fail on the
input, if `S_A` is not a valid `A` program.



Open Question
-------------

Given a compiler `C_AA` written in its own language. Is it possible to write an
interpreter `u` in `PA` which interprets `LA`?

If the answer to this question is yes, then a compiler for a total language
cannot be written in its own language.

More general: Assuming that `C_AA` exists and `LA` is total. Does this lead to a
contradiction?
