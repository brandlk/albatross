type t

(**

A build context consists of a context with holes and a stack of to be
constructed terms.

There is always a next to be constructed term. The term is either in a function
position or an argument position.

val count: t -> int

val count_base: t -> int

val count_locals: t -> int

val count_bounds: t -> int



val make: Gamma.t -> t
(**
    [make gamma]

    Make a build context based on [gamma]. Push 2 holes onto the context to get

    Gamma, E: Any(2), e: E

    The next to be constructed term points to [e].
*)


val final:

(** {1 Terminals } *)



val base_candidate: Term.t -> int -> t -> t option
(**
    [base_candidate term nargs bc]

    Receive the term [term] as a candidate for the next to be constructed term.
    The candidate is from the base context and in applied to [nargs] arguments.

    Base candidates are either

    - Literals (Numbers, characters, strings)

    - Variables from the base context
*)


val bound: int -> int -> t -> (t, Term.typ * Gamma.t) result
(**
    [bound level nargs bc]
*)



(*
val candidate: Term.t -> t -> t option
(**
    [candidate term bc]

    Receive the term [term] as a candidate for the next to be constructed term.

    Candidates are either

    - Base candidates

    - Bound variables


New placeholder for implicit arguments have to be generated in case that the
required type is not just a placeholder. The candidate term has to be applied to
the implicit arguments before assigning it to the next to be constructed term.
